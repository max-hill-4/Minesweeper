CMP1902M Assessment Task 2: Implement the Minesweeper game

â€¢   Minesweeper is a retro single-player puzzle game (Wikipedia). The objective is to find all the
    mines within a grid, based on the help of cues that provide the number of mines in the adjacent
    squares. You can play the game here. For Task 2 you will develop a playable version of the
    game where the user will interact using the terminal as an interface (no GUI is needed).
